# runescape-ctrl1
This is the monorepo for the ctrl1 app and plugins.

ctrl1 is based on the [alt1 toolkit](https://github.com/skillbert/alt1).
alt1 is widely used by many RuneScape players as it offers many gameplay enhancing features.

In the past, there have been app developers creating alternative client / libraries for RuneScape.
Unfortunately, some of them ended up putting malicious code inside and stealing thousands of accounts.
alt1 is a great tool however there are a few things I do not like about it.
