# runescape-ctrl1
ctrl1 is based on the [alt1 toolkit](https://github.com/skillbert/alt1).
alt1 is widely used by many RuneScape players because it offers many gameplay enhancing features.

In the past, there have been app developers creating alternative client / libraries for RuneScape.
Unfortunately, some of them ended up putting malicious code inside and stealing thousands of accounts.

I enjoy alt1 but I do not want to put my account at risk, I also do not like the coding style used by the original creator so I'll be making my own version of it :)
